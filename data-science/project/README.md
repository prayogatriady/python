# Greetings! 
## Welcome to my data science project portfolio

### 1. Iris Classification with KNN
* Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to predict iris species based on petal characteristics
* Applied [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm with and without python sklearn library (calculate [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) manually)

### 2. Sales Prediction
* Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to predict sales of the product based on the advertising cost for each platform.
* Explored the dataset to identify the correlation and performed [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) model to predict sales of the product.
* Encourage the stakeholder to establish further business problems.

### 3. Iris Classification with Random Forest
* Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to predict iris species based on petal characteristics
* Applied [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm.

### 4. House Price Prediction
* Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to predict house prices in Bangalore, India.
* Explored the dataset to detect the anomaly and performed feature engineering to achieve the best model which suitable for the dataset.
* Accommodate an insight for the citizen who is about to live in Bangalore.

### 5. Data Science Salary EDA
* Utilized python to perform exploratory data analysis techniques to find the best data science job since 2020.
* Explored the dataset to catch patterns and relations among the available categories
* Help out job seekers to compare the best data science job based on company location

### 6. Gender Face Recognition
* Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to predict gender by face image
* Applied computer vision library to detect face and train the training set data
* Help out the stakeholder to classify gender
