# Iris Classifier with KNN

[The Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

We would like to create a model with K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

Our KNN use eucledian distance.

[Euclidean distance equation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)

$$
d(x,y) = \sqrt {(x_{1} - y_{1})^2 + (x_{2} - y_{2})^2}
$$
