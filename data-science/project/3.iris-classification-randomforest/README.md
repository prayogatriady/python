# Iris Classifier with Random Forest

[The Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

We would like to create a model with [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm.
